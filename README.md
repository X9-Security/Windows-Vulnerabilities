# Windows-Vulnerabilities

This is an excel sheet with a collection of Windows versions and Microsoft Security Bulletins that affect them. Privilege Escalation (PE), Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Information Disclosure (ID) are listed per each vulnerability. This is meant to be a handy reference for penetration testers or red teamers when targeting windows systems.
